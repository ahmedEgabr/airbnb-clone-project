- **Frameworks:** Flask, Jinja2
- **Storage Engine:** File Storage & MySQL DB (ORM abstraction)
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3
- **Deployment:** Linux / Ubuntu, Nginx, Gunicorn
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 👥 Contributors

This project is part of the ALX SE curriculum and will be developed in multiple phases as a team.

🧰 Technology Stack

This project uses a collection of technologies across backend, frontend, and deployment layers. Each tool plays a critical role in building and running the AirBnB clone.

| Technology              | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Python**              | The core programming language used to build the backend logic and data models. |
| **Flask**               | A lightweight Python web framework used to create RESTful APIs and serve dynamic web pages. |
| **MySQL**               | Relational database used to store user, property, booking, and review data. |
| **SQLAlchemy**          | ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) used to interact with the database using Python objects instead of raw SQL. |
| **HTML/CSS**            | Used to build and style the user interface of the website.   |
| **Jinja2**              | Templating engine integrated with Flask to dynamically generate HTML pages from Python. |
| **JavaScript**          | Enables client-side interactivity, form validation, and dynamic page behavior. |
| **Git**                 | Version control system for tracking source code changes and enabling team collaboration. |
| **GitHub**              | Online Git repository hosting platform used for source control and project collaboration. |
| **Linux/Ubuntu**        | Operating system used for deployment and testing of the project in a production-like environment. |
| **Nginx**               | A web server used as a reverse proxy to serve the Flask app in production. |
| **Gunicorn**            | A WSGI HTTP server for running Python web applications in production with high performance. |
| **Docker** *(optional)* | Containerization platform that ensures consistency across development and production environments. |




### 🗃️ Database Design

The AirBnB clone project relies on a relational database structure. Below are the core entities (tables), key fields, and how they relate to each other.

------

#### 🏠 **Property Management**

Allows users to list properties with details like title, location, price, and description. Property owners can update or delete listings, giving them full control over their rental offerings.

------

#### 📅 **Booking System**

Enables guests to book available properties by selecting check-in and check-out dates. It checks for availability, calculates total cost, and prevents double bookings.
