# AirBnB Clone Project

Welcome to the **AirBnB Clone** project ‚Äì a foundational part of the ALX Software Engineering program.

## üß† Project Overview

This project is a **full-stack clone** of the AirBnB web application, built step-by-step to demonstrate understanding of core backend and frontend development concepts. The goal is to rebuild AirBnB‚Äôs core functionality and design using a modular and scalable architecture.

## üéØ Project Goals

- Build a flexible and reusable backend system in Python
- Create a functional command interpreter (console)
- Implement object-relational mapping (ORM) from scratch
- Connect a backend to a dynamic front-end using Flask and HTML/CSS
- Deploy a fully working web application

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3
- **Frameworks:** Flask, Jinja2
- **Storage Engine:** File Storage & MySQL DB (ORM abstraction)
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3
- **Deployment:** Linux / Ubuntu, Nginx, Gunicorn
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## üë• Contributors

This project is part of the ALX SE curriculum and will be developed in multiple phases as a team.

üë• Team Roles

This project involves collaboration among various team members, each with specific responsibilities. Below are the roles and their key duties:
üîπ Backend Developer

    Responsible for building the core logic of the application.

    Implements models, APIs, business logic, and integrates the database with the app.

    Ensures clean, testable, and scalable backend code.

üîπ Frontend Developer

    Designs and develops the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or frontend frameworks).

    Connects frontend with backend via API endpoints.

    Focuses on responsive, user-friendly, and accessible UI design.

üîπ Database Administrator (DBA)

    Manages the data layer: setting up databases, optimizing queries, ensuring data integrity.

    Designs schemas and relationships for models (e.g., User, Place, Review).

    Handles data backup, migration, and performance tuning.

üîπ DevOps Engineer

    Sets up version control, CI/CD pipelines, deployment environments, and monitors system health.

    Ensures the app is smoothly deployed to production using tools like Docker, Nginx, and Gunicorn.

    Manages server environments and scaling strategies.

üîπ QA Engineer / Tester

    Writes and runs unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure code correctness.

    Finds and documents bugs or performance issues.

    Ensures reliability and compliance with project requirements.

üîπ Project Manager / Scrum Lead (optional role in larger teams)

    Coordinates between different team members.

    Tracks task progress, manages deadlines, and removes blockers.

    Ensures project is aligned with goals and learning outcomes.


üß∞ Technology Stack

This project uses a collection of technologies across backend, frontend, and deployment layers. Each tool plays a critical role in building and running the AirBnB clone.

| Technology              | Description                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Python**              | The core programming language used to build the backend logic and data models. |
| **Flask**               | A lightweight Python web framework used to create RESTful APIs and serve dynamic web pages. |
| **MySQL**               | Relational database used to store user, property, booking, and review data. |
| **SQLAlchemy**          | ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) used to interact with the database using Python objects instead of raw SQL. |
| **HTML/CSS**            | Used to build and style the user interface of the website.   |
| **Jinja2**              | Templating engine integrated with Flask to dynamically generate HTML pages from Python. |
| **JavaScript**          | Enables client-side interactivity, form validation, and dynamic page behavior. |
| **Git**                 | Version control system for tracking source code changes and enabling team collaboration. |
| **GitHub**              | Online Git repository hosting platform used for source control and project collaboration. |
| **Linux/Ubuntu**        | Operating system used for deployment and testing of the project in a production-like environment. |
| **Nginx**               | A web server used as a reverse proxy to serve the Flask app in production. |
| **Gunicorn**            | A WSGI HTTP server for running Python web applications in production with high performance. |
| **Docker** *(optional)* | Containerization platform that ensures consistency across development and production environments. |
