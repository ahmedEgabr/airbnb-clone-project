# AirBnB Clone Project

Welcome to the **AirBnB Clone** project – a foundational part of the ALX Software Engineering program.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project is a **full-stack clone** of the AirBnB web application, built step-by-step to demonstrate understanding of core backend and frontend development concepts. The goal is to rebuild AirBnB’s core functionality and design using a modular and scalable architecture.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a flexible and reusable backend system in Python
- Create a functional command interpreter (console)
- Implement object-relational mapping (ORM) from scratch
- Connect a backend to a dynamic front-end using Flask and HTML/CSS
- Deploy a fully working web application

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3
- **Frameworks:** Flask, Jinja2
- **Storage Engine:** File Storage & MySQL DB (ORM abstraction)
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3
- **Deployment:** Linux / Ubuntu, Nginx, Gunicorn
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 👥 Contributors

This project is part of the ALX SE curriculum and will be developed in multiple phases as a team.
